- project: "aMUSED: An Open MUSE Reproduction"
  role: Author
  # duration: 2012 &mdash; Present
  url: "https://github.com/huggingface/amused"
  description: Amused is a lightweight text to image model based off of the muse architecture. Amused is particularly useful in applications that require a lightweight and fast model such as generating many images quickly at once.
